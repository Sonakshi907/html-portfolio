<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi,Myself Sonakshi Agarwal with so much chao,excitement i started my journey of learning something new,something in which i face difficulty ,something which helps me to make myself more better or maybe even better.
  Currentl I am pursuing BCA from DIT UNIVERSITY, Dehradun,and yup i will be in my 2nd year.
  </p>

<p>What I like to do? I feel that I am a person that wants to explore new things and thoughtfully my this hobby puts me into troubles but ya i just like to explore new city,places,restaurants and specially the small chaotic activities that make me feel that i can do it and hmmm.. everyone can do so why me not?
  and ya its all about me .</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
